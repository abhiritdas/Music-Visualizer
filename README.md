# Music-Visualizer
This Python program utilizes a flask webapp to prompt the user to input a song from YouTube.
Then, the audio mp4 file for the video gets downladed using the Pytube API and goes through a file conversion to become a .wav file. 
The program then sets up a pygame window and begins playing a cool "bar-wave" animation that follows the rhythms and volume dynamics of the audio!



To run program on your computer:

  - Install all the Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt

  - Run main.py from source folder
